Dive into the cutting-edge intersection of DevOps and AI with AutoCoder. This project guides you to build a reusable GitHub Action that leverages Generative AI to auto-generate code. You will create workflows, interact with OpenAI using scripts, enforce security standards, and eventually convert your project to a reusable GitHub Action to share with others or show off in your portfolio.

- **Create Workflows:** Design and implement efficient workflows that streamline the development process, ensuring seamless integration and continuous delivery.
- Interact with OpenAI: Utilize scripts to interact with OpenAI's powerful language models, enabling the generation of high-quality code snippets tailored to your specific needs.
- Enforce Security Standards: Implement robust security measures to protect your code and data, ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices.
- Convert to Reusable GitHub Action: Transform your project into a reusable GitHub Action, allowing you to share your work with the community or showcase it in your professional portfolio.
